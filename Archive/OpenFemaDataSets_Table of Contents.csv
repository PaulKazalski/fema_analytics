openfema-33,MissionAssignments,Mission Assignments,"1.1 What is the data in the submission?

Mission Assignment, as defined in the 44 Code of Federal Regulations, is a work order issued by FEMA to another Federal agency directing completion of a specified task and citing funding, other managerial controls, and guidance. 

Mission Assignments are essential and powerful tools for federal emergency management under the Stafford Act.  Mission Assignments are distinct because they allow for deployment, employment and assistance from the full range of federal resources to support disaster needs.

1.2 Why does FEMA Issue Mission Assignments?

FEMA issues mission assignments in anticipation of, or in response to, a Presidential declaration of an emergency or major disaster.  The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) authorizes Mission Assignments.

When States, Tribes, or Territories are overwhelmed by disaster impacts, FEMA can fulfill requests for Federal assistance through a Mission Assignment.  Mission Assignments are provided as a sourcing mechanism to direct and reimburse Other Federal Agencies for utilizing their capabilities to support disaster operations.  Reimbursement of eligible expenditures are detailed in 44 Code of Federal Regulations 206.8 (c).

1.3 How are Mission Assignments Created?

Mission Assignments are administered, created and obligated, using DRF appropriations, as electronic forms within FEMA's financial systems.  Each mission assignment includes essential information required to direct other Federal Agencies to support and fulfill disaster needs, such as  cost estimates, location of need, requestor, statement of work and period of performance.  Mission Assignments can be amended to reflect the tempo of disaster activities, by changing period of performance dates, increasing and decreasing the costs required to complete the work, or recouping dollars based on early work completion or cancellation.  This process of financially managing DRF dollars is an ongoing process that takes place before, during and after disaster activities have ended.  Initial mission assignment obligation amounts do not reflect true costs incurred after billing and reimbursement.

This data set contains information required as part of Congressional bill - the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2019.   FEMA is providing the following information for stakeholders:
'State or Tribal Government
'Disaster Number
'Description of Disaster 
'Agency
'Request for Assistance
'Obligations/Estimate
'Date Obligated
'Percentage of Cost for which the State or Tribal Government is responsible (the cost share)

For more information on Mission Assignments, the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, and the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2019 visit https://www.fema.gov


1.4 How is the data generated?

The data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all mission assignments for FEMA's Mission Assignment (MA) program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA's Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data.


1.5 How can the data be used?

The data provides information regarding mission assignments issued to other federal agencies in response to Stafford Act incidents.  

Note: The disaster costs reflected are not actual they include inflated estimations to ensure resources are available to address actual and potential life-saving, life-sustaining, and or mission-critical needs. This dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial report and should not be considered an official federal report.

The EMPG Program provides resources to assist state, local, tribal and territorial governments in preparing for all hazards, as authorized by Section 662 of the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (6 U.S.C ' 762) and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. '' 5121 et seq.). Title VI of the Stafford Act authorizes FEMA to make grants for the purpose of providing a system of emergency preparedness for the protection of life and property in the United States from hazards and to vest responsibility for emergency preparedness jointly in the federal government and the states and their political subdivisions. The FY 2016 EMPG will provide federal funds to assist state, local, tribal and territorial emergency management agencies to obtain the resources required to support the National Preparedness Goal's (NPG's) (the Goal's) associated mission areas and core capabilities. The federal government, through the EMPG Program, provides necessary direction, coordination, and guidance, and provides necessary assistance, as authorized in this title to support a comprehensive all hazards emergency preparedness system. 

The Emergency Management Performance Grant Program is to support a comprehensive, all-hazard emergency preparedness system by building and sustaining the core capabilities contained in the National Preparedness Goal. 
Examples include: 

-Completing the Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA) process; 
-Strengthening a state or community's emergency management governance structures; 
-Updating and approving specific emergency plans; 
-Designing and conducting exercises that enable whole community stakeholders to examine and validate core capabilities and the plans needed to deliver them to the targets identified through the THIRA; 
-Targeting training and verifying identified capabilities;

ND and AFG are awarded and managed differently within GPD and should be treated with discretion.

The only measure in this data set is Award Amount. It is an additive measure that can be applied across multiple dimensions to create various views of the data.

AFG awards are assigned to individual Fire Departments. ND Grants are typically assigned to state agencies; however, exceptions do exist such as Port Security Grant Program which is assigned to port areas and not States. It is important to know that when looking at Award Amount by State it does not mean the State actually received that money. In addition, some grant programs may have pass-through requirements where the recipient State is required to sub-grant a minimum amount of the award and only retain a portion of the award.

Grants guidance is described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Each grant program has its own grant guidance containing eligibility requirements, program objectives, and funding restrictions which are published annually. FOAs are public documents and may be found online at www.fema.gov/grants.

openfema-23,IndividualAssistanceHousingRegistrantsLargeDisasters,Individual Assistance Housing Registrants Large Disasters,"1.1. What is the data in the submission?

Individual Assistance is provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to individuals and families who have sustained losses due to disasters.

Homeowners, renters, and business owners in designated counties who sustained damage to their homes, vehicles, personal property, businesses, or inventory as a result of a federally declared disaster may apply for disaster assistance.

Disaster assistance may include grants to help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured and underinsured personal property losses, and medical, dental, and funeral expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related expenses.

Disaster assistance grants are not taxable income and will not affect eligibility for Social Security, Medicaid, medical waiver programs, welfare assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, or Social Security Disability Insurance.

This dataset contains detailed non-PII data on the Individuals and Households Program (IHP). FEMA provides assistance to individuals and households through the Individual Assistance (IA) program, which includes all of the following: Mass Care and Emergency Assistance (MC/EA); Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP); Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA); Disaster Legal Services (DLS); Disaster Case Management (DCM); and Individuals and Households Program (IHP). IHP is comprised of two categories of assistance: Housing Assistance (HA) and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). For more information read FEMA's IHP unified guidance: https://www.fema.gov/ihp-unified-guidance

Individual data elements and descriptions are listed in the metadata information within the dataset.

1.2. How is it generated?

The data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all cases for FEMA's Individual Assistance (IA) program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA's Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data.

1.3. How can the data be used?

The data can be used to analyze FEMA's IA program response attributes. This could particularly help local and state governments and non-governmental organizations put together applications for funding from the Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program for rebuilding efforts during and after major disaster declarations. This data was instrumental in Hurricane Sandy community rebuilding and is designed for use in the 2017 hurricane season recovery and beyond.

OpenFEMA customers can comprehensively identify data trends that demonstrate needs of particular communities. For example, large numbers of households with elderly residents in areas susceptible to flooding who may need specific design considerations in home elevation, or low-income renters concentrated in communities where additional assistance may be needed to improve recovery.

Community groups in Texas assisting survivors with their recovery must have accurate and comprehensive data to allocate resources and design recovery programs to accurately and fairly meet the true needs of Texans, particularly the most vulnerable households and communities. The public must have access to this data in order to understand and evaluate state and local recovery plans, and advocate for an effective and equitable recovery.

openfema-11,HazardMitigationGrantProgramPropertyAcquisitions,Hazard Mitigation Grant Program Property Acquisitions,"This dataset lists properties from completed acquisition projects funded under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). The HMGP provides grants to states and local governments to implement long-term hazard mitigation measures after a major disaster declaration. Acquisition projects funded under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) are voluntary and one is under no obligation to sell their home. Acquisition projects are based on the principle of fair compensation for property. Property acquisitions present owners with an opportunity to recoup a large part of their investment in property that probably has lost some, if not most of its value due to damage after a disaster. Under the Stafford Act, any land purchased with Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds must be restricted to open space, recreational, and wetlands management uses in perpetuity

Acquisition or Buyout projects, while 75 percent funded by FEMA, are administered by the State and local communities. FEMA does not buy properties directly from the property owners. Communities may offer homeowners who agree to participate in a buyout project up to the fair market value of the home before the disaster struck. A licensed appraiser hired by the community determines the fair market value. No one is obligated to sell their home; these are transactions and prices that both the property owner and communities agreed on. For More information on HMGP please visit http://www.fema.gov/hazard-mitigation-grant-program and HMGP FAQs http://www.fema.gov/hazard-mitigation-grant-programs-frequently-ask-questions.

Missing values - In some cases the projects are closed and the data was simply not provided by the sub-grantee or the Grantee and/or entered into the HMGP system.

openfema-13,HousingAssistanceRenters,FEMA Housing Assistance Program Data - Renters - V1,"The dataset was generated by FEMA's ECIM Reporting team, and is primarily composed of data from Housing Assistance Program reporting authority from FEMA registration renters and owners within the state, county, zip where the registration is valid. 

This dataset contains aggregated, non-PII data generated by FEMA's Enterprise Coordination & Information Management (ECIM) reporting team to share data on FEMA's Housing Assistance Program within the state, county, zip where the registration is valid for the declarations, starting with disaster declarations number 4116.

Data is self-reported and as such is subject to human error. To learn more about disaster assistance please visit https://www.fema.gov/individual-disaster-assistance.

This dataset is not intended to be an official federal report, and should it be considered an official federal report. 

This is raw, unedited data from FEMA's National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS) and as such is subject to a small percentage of human error. For example, when an applicant registers they enter their street and city address.  The system runs a check and suggests a county.  The applicant, if registering online can override that choice.  If they are registering via the call center the Human Services Specialist (HSS) representatives is instructed to ask (not offer) what county they live in.  So even though the system might suggest County A,  an applicant has the right to choose County B.  

The financial information is derived from NEMIS and not FEMA's official financial systems.  Due to differences in reporting periods, status of obligations and how business rules are applied, this financial information may differ slightly from official publication on public websites such as usaspending.gov;  this dataset is not intended to be used for any official federal financial reporting.
